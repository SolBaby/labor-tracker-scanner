looking to build a labor tracking system that leverages barcode or scanner technology to track employee attendance and the time they spend on tasks. This system aims to automate the process of tracking employees’ work hours and task completion in real-time.

Key Features of Your Labor Tracking System:

	1.	Barcode Scanning: Employees and tasks are identified via unique barcodes or QR codes. Employees scan their IDs when they start and stop tasks, allowing the system to log attendance and the time spent on each task automatically.
	2.	Time Tracking: The system records the exact time employees begin and end tasks, calculating the total time spent on each task. This can help in monitoring productivity and ensuring that employees are compensated for the correct number of hours worked.
	3.	Attendance Management: The system keeps track of when employees are present and working, ensuring that attendance is accurately recorded. This feature can be extended to monitor employees’ clock-in and clock-out times.
	4.	Task Management: Employees scan a barcode for each task they perform. The system then logs these tasks, tracking the duration each task takes to complete. This can help measure efficiency, manage task load distribution, and provide detailed task reporting.
	5.	Database Storage: All the data (employee details, task details, time logs) is stored in a database (such as SQLite), which allows you to retrieve and analyze historical data, generate reports, and identify trends.
	6.	Reporting: You’ll eventually want to create reports that show task durations, employee productivity, and attendance logs. These reports can be used to evaluate performance, adjust schedules, and optimize processes.

Ideal Use Cases:

	•	Manufacturing Facilities: Track workers’ tasks on an assembly line, monitor productivity, and measure the time spent on each step of the process.
	•	Warehouses: Track picking, packing, and shipping tasks to ensure operations are efficient and workers are meeting expected task completion times.
	•	Field Work: In environments like construction or outdoor labor, employees can scan in their tasks (e.g., starting a particular job) and track time worked.

Components of the System:

	1.	Barcode Scanner: The scanner reads employee ID badges and task labels. This scanner can be a physical handheld device, a smartphone camera (with appropriate software), or a keyboard emulator.
	2.	User Interface: Employees interact with the system by scanning their IDs and tasks. The interface could be simple, like a command-line interface (CLI), or more advanced, such as a web or desktop application.
	3.	Database: A system backend, usually a relational database, stores all employee records, task details, and time logs. This allows for querying and reporting.
	4.	Automation: The system removes the need for manual timesheets and task tracking, reducing errors and administrative overhead.

Benefits of the System:

	•	Efficiency: Automates time tracking, reducing the time and effort needed to log hours worked manually.
	•	Accuracy: Minimizes human error by using barcode technology for logging work, ensuring precise time tracking and task management.
	•	Data Insights: The system can generate valuable insights about employee productivity, task efficiency, and labor costs by tracking time data in detail.

Future Enhancements:

	•	Web Interface: You could eventually integrate this with a web interface where managers and employees can check in and track performance, progress, or manage tasks remotely.
	•	Mobile Integration: Employees could use their smartphones as barcode scanners to log tasks, providing more flexibility in tracking work across different locations.
	•	Integration with Payroll: You could integrate the system with payroll software to automatically calculate wages based on hours worked and tasks completed.

Overall Purpose:

Your goal is to streamline and automate the process of logging employee work hours and tasks by using barcode scanners, providing a more efficient and accurate system for tracking labor and task progress in real-time. This system will provide visibility into task durations, improve employee accountability, and help optimize workforce productivity.
