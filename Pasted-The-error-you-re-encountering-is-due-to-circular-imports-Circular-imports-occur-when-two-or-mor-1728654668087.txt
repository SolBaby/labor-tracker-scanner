The error you're encountering is due to **circular imports**. Circular imports occur when two or more modules depend on each other, causing Python to get stuck in a loop when trying to resolve dependencies. In your case, the `routes` module is importing `create_app` from `app.py`, and `app.py` is importing something from `routes.py`, causing the circular dependency.

### Hereâ€™s how to fix it:

1. **Break the circular import** by restructuring your code. Typically, you'd move the code that initializes the app and defines routes to separate locations to reduce dependencies between modules.

2. **Example of restructuring your files**:

#### Original structure:
- `main.py`
- `app.py`
- `routes.py`

### Proposed Restructuring

#### 1. **Create a separate `routes.py` that does not depend on `app.py` initialization**
In the `routes.py`, don't create the app instance. Instead, simply define the routes and keep it decoupled from the application itself.

```python
# routes.py
from flask import Blueprint

# Create a Blueprint for the routes
routes_bp = Blueprint('routes', __name__)

@routes_bp.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello from routes!'
```

#### 2. **Modify `app.py` to import routes separately**
In `app.py`, define the app creation logic and register the `Blueprint` from `routes.py`.

```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask
from routes import routes_bp  # Import the Blueprint

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)

    # Register the routes Blueprint
    app.register_blueprint(routes_bp)

    return app
```

#### 3. **Keep `main.py` as the entry point**
`main.py` should only be responsible for running the application:

```python
# main.py
from app import create_app

app = create_app()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### 4. **Explanation**:
- The **Blueprint** in `routes.py` separates route definitions from app creation, which prevents the circular import.
- The `app.py` file now only focuses on creating the Flask app and registering the `Blueprint`.
- `main.py` is used just to start the app.

### 5. **Circular import resolved**:
By separating the routes logic from the app creation and using a `Blueprint`, the dependency loop is broken, and the circular import issue is resolved.
